we need node.js as our host to server our backend

node.js requires few dependencies (packages) to make development more efficient

do npm init to make a package for our personal project
we get package.json (package file has all the information related to the backend we craeted)
it has a extension .json (JavaScript Object Notation)

{
    key:value,
    key:value,
    key:value,
    key:value,
    key:value,
    key:value
}

json file format are easy to raed and understand for front and backend i.e. it can be used for communication between two system such as frontend and backend

<!-- express.js -->

express.js is a framework which helps us to craete a server this server can do activities like routing, serving, TCP protocol (HTTP)(FTP), create a api, we can make registration and login system using token (JWT),
bcrpty.

<!-- complete backend is javascript based -->

to install any packages do npm install package-name
